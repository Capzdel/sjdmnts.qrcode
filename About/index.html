    		<p>Our school is very organize regarding to the protocol in our pandemic situation like, when you enter in the school you need to write your name in the contact tracing paper and check the temperature of each other. I see the problem in the contact tracing because, it  causes a  long line in the entrance of the school and sometimes, it will not follow the rules of social distancing.  Most of the people are not following the rules and regulation in school. Sometimes we interact some people that we didn’t know if who is sick or not.</p>

    	<div class="Third">
    		<p> The solution of this innovation is to use Qr code for contact tracing and to avoid long line in the entrance. Especially for those who in hurry. And also, less work to the guard or the people who assign in the entrance. So, they don’t need to distribute the paper for contact tracing. The only thing that they need to do is scan the Qr Code and that’s all. This innovation is a good solution to this problem. It will less work and less time. And also, we they don’t to write contact tracing. Qr code help us to make easier and effective alternative way for contact tracing. Lastly, we always put in our mind to follow all the rules and regulation about the pandemic situation.</p>
